#  Rust Client for Proton SQL Streaming Engine
 
Rust client for [Proton / TimePlus]([url](https://www.timeplus.com/)https://www.timeplus.com/). 

Proton is a streaming SQL engine, a fast and lightweight alternative to Apache Flink, ðŸš€ powered by ClickHouse. It enables developers to solve streaming data processing, routing and analytics challenges from Apache Kafka, Redpanda and more sources, and send aggregated data to the downstream systems. Proton is the core engine of [Timeplus](https://timeplus.com), which is a cloud native streaming analytics platform.


## Install proton

```
brew install proton
```

1. Start the Proton server:
   $ proton server start

2. In a separate terminal, connect to the server:
   $ proton client
   (Note: If you encounter a 'connection refused' error, use: proton client --host 127.0.0.1)

3. To terminate the server, press ctrl+c in the server terminal.

   For detailed usage and more information, check out the Timeplus documentation:
