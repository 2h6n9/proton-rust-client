#  Rust Client for Proton

Rust client for [Timeplus Proton](https://github.com/timeplus-io/proton).

Proton is a streaming SQL engine, a fast and lightweight alternative to Apache Flink, ðŸš€ powered by ClickHouse. It enables developers to solve streaming data processing, routing and analytics challenges from Apache Kafka, Redpanda and more sources, and send aggregated data to the downstream systems. Proton is the core engine of [Timeplus](https://timeplus.com), which is a cloud native streaming analytics platform.

The initial version(0.1.0) of the client was written by [Marvin Hansen](https://github.com/marvin-hansen). Thanks for the contribution.

## Install Proton

### As a single binary

On Linux or Mac, you can install it via `curl https://install.timeplus.com | sh`

On Mac, you can also install it via `brew install proton`

After you get the `proton` binary, you can start the Proton server via `proton server start`

In a separate terminal, connect to the server via `proton client` (Note: If you encounter a 'connection refused' error, use: proton client --host 127.0.0.1)

### As a Docker container

```bash
docker run -d --pull always --name proton ghcr.io/timeplus-io/proton:latest
```

Proton is automatically started. Open the terminal of the container, and run `proton client`


For detailed usage and more information, check out the documentation: https://docs.timeplus.com/proton
